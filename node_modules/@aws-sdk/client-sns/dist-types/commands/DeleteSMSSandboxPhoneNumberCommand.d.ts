/**
 * <p>Deletes an Amazon Web Services account's verified or pending phone number from the SMS sandbox.</p>
 *         <p>When you start using Amazon SNS to send SMS messages, your Amazon Web Services account is in the
 *                 <i>SMS sandbox</i>. The SMS sandbox provides a safe environment for
 *                 you to try Amazon SNS features without risking your reputation as an SMS sender. While your
 *                 Amazon Web Services account is in the SMS sandbox, you can use all of the features of Amazon SNS. However, you can send
 *                 SMS messages only to verified destination phone numbers. For more information, including how to
 *                 move out of the sandbox to send messages without restrictions,
 *                 see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html">SMS sandbox</a> in
 *                 the <i>Amazon SNS Developer Guide</i>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SNSClient, DeleteSMSSandboxPhoneNumberCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sns"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SNSClient, DeleteSMSSandboxPhoneNumberCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sns"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SNSClient(config);
 * const command = new DeleteSMSSandboxPhoneNumberCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteSMSSandboxPhoneNumberCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteSMSSandboxPhoneNumberCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link SNSClientResolvedConfig | config} for SNSClient's `config` shape.
