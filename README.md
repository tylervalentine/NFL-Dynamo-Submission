### Introduction

Random-Questions-Submission is a simple application to submit data to an Amazon DynamoDB table. This project is based a cross-service Node.js tutorial featured on [this AWS link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/cross-service-example-submitting-data.html). Once the application is running, it will ask the user randomly-generated questions from the 'generate questions' button. The 'submit' button at the bottom of the application will send all previous answers to the DynamoDB table.
